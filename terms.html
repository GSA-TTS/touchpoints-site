        TOUCHPOINTS TERMS OF SERVICE FOR HIGH IMPACT SERVICE PROVIDERS
        <br />
        ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
      </p>
      <p>Version 1.1, updated: 08/12/2024</p>
      <h3 id="summary">1.1 SERVICE SUMMARY</h3>
      <p>
        "Touchpoints" is an open-source software application created and
        maintained by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) provided to
        agencies at no-cost for the terms of service outlined in this document.
        Touchpoints enables government agencies to solicit and process user
        feedback to support the continuous improvement of public systems,
        services, processes, and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following terms of service ("Term") governing GSA's Touchpoints
        website and services, including the content, documentation, code, and
        related materials are offered subject to your acceptance of the Terms,
        as well as any relevant sections of the Touchpoints Site Policies
        (collectively, the "Agreement"). Access to or use of Touchpoints
        services or its content constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, Touchpoints is for use by High Impact Service Providers and
        other agencies beginning to collect customer feedback in line with

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>2.2 SECURITY</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Touchpoints is covered by a Federal Information Processing Standards
          (FIPS) 199 Moderate ATO. Details can be found in the Touchpoints
          System Security Plan (SSP) document. Agencies may request a copy of
          the SSP by contacting the Touchpoints team at
          feedback-analytics@gsa.gov.
        </li>
        <li>Data is encrypted via HTTPS while in transit.</li>
        <li>
          Data is encrypted in cloud.gov's database at rest through the Amazon
          Relational Database Service (RDS).
        </li>
        <li>
          Users are logged out of the Touchpoints application after 30 minutes
          of inactivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Touchpoints uses multiple security methods to protect this U.S.
          government service and agency data to ensure the service remains
          available to all users. These methods include monitoring and recording
          network traffic (any data going in and out of Touchpoints) to identify
          unauthorized attempts to change information or otherwise cause damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unauthorized access or use of Touchpoints (e.g. use for criminal
          purposes or to cause damage) is against the law, and may subject
          individuals to criminal prosecution and penalties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>2.3 DATA PRIVACY AND MANAGEMENT</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Although GSA will own the data generated by these collections, it
          agrees not to disclose the data or allow access to any person outside
          the Feedback Analytics team except pursuant to a Freedom of
          Information Act (FOIA) request, Government Accountability Office or
          Inspector General engagements as appropriate, and as authorized by
          Federal statute or regulation or pursuant to a court order from a
          court of competent jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Agency users own any data that they export and download from their
          Touchpoints account.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the purposes of data security and data use, GSA assumes all
          liability for its government staff and contractors with access to the
          data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Outside of GSA's described use of sharing certified data with OMB in
          the manner described in OMB Circular A-11 Section 280, GSA shall not
          disclose, release, reveal, show, sell, rent, lease, loan, or otherwise
          grant access to the information and data shared and/or emanating from
          the activities covered by this Agreement to any person.
        </li>
        <li>
          GSA further agrees that access to the data generated in these
          collections shall be limited to the minimum number of individuals
          required to manage the Touchpoints service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Touchpoints provides the ability for agency Form Managers to "flag"
          survey submissions in the event they contain spam, irrelevant, or
          abusive content. Records of these submissions may be retained by GSA
          in audit logs for security compliance and applicable data retention
          policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          GSA will retain survey instrument and submission data as advised in
          the following record schedules:
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              352.2 – Information Hosting Records
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This group of records is focused on the information services
                  that GSA provides to others outside of GSA. Examples include
                  Data.gov and USA.gov. Such activities include creating and
                  maintaining web content for both the public and outside the
                  agency, and related records in developing and managing and
                  closing down such a service.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  This series consists of content (information and documents) in
                  a variety of formats posted by GSA on agency web sites hosted
                  by GSA, and content posted on, or submitted via, those web
                  sites by the public. Included are static web pages,
                  historically insignificant public dialogues such as forums,
                  surveys, and comment postings, regulatory or statutorily
                  mandated public postings, and related records. This schedule
                  item covers copies of content received from agencies and
                  posted by GSA on the web sites. The record copy of the content
                  (retained by the originating agency) is covered by the records
                  schedules of the agencies that originated the content. The
                  content posted to the web sites by the public is covered by
                  this schedule item.

                  which the posting becomes superseded, obsolete, or canceled.
                  Destroy 3 years after cutoff. Longer retention is authorized
                  in order to comply with requirements for public posting
                  stipulated by regulation, agency directives, OMB or GAO
                  mandates, or similar authorities.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  This series of records is concerned with creating and managing
                  an information resource (e.g., Data.gov and USA.gov) for use
                  or reference by the public and/or Federal agencies in carrying
                  out their work. Included are change management decisions,
                  planning documents, promotional materials, review reports,
                  correspondence, and related records.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Temporary</i>. Cut off at the end of the fiscal year.
                  Destroy 3 years after cutoff. Longer retention is authorized
                  if required for statutory or authoritative reasons, such as
                  directives agreements, contracts, OMB or GAO requirements, or
                  similar authorities.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          GSA may maintain data sets developed from the data and store them
          under the security parameters described above so long as GSA removes
          any personally identifiable information, confidential or sensitive
          information from such data sets (as defined by the customer agency
          point of contact), in the event personally identifiable information or
          other sensitive information was inadvertently included in the dataset
          collected by GSA.

      <h3 id="touchpoints">3.0 USE OF TOUCHPOINTS</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Onboarding</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You should identify an "Organization Manager." This person will be
          given detailed information about the tool and participate in a demo.
          After answering a few key questions, a Touchpoints account will be
          created for this user and training will be given as needed in order to
          commence the onboarding process.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Feedback Analytics team will reach out to this Organization
          Manager to begin to develop the agency's internal account structure
          (additional owners, service managers, people that may view submissions
          only, etc.). Additional individuals identified by agency staff will be
          given Touchpoints accounts as relevant. Agency shall be responsible
          for notifying Feedback Analytics staff of user accounts that should be
          deactivated due to reassignment or separation from service.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Feedback Analytics team will provide approximately 20 hours of
          onboarding support to discuss Touchpoints account management,
          identification of initial survey point, and will coordinate PRA
          approval of A-11 survey questions on behalf of agency.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>Set-up</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Touchpoints generates a public survey URL that customers can access
          (e.g, via an agency's email servers or social media accounts), on a
          kiosk (via agency-owned hardware such as tablets, phones, or computers
          available at service centers) or embedded in a website online.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2023, the A-11 survey was updated as a simplified, more
          user-friendly revision to the original A-11 survey. The second version
          of the A-11 survey presents 3 questions to the user;
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1. A thumbs up/down button with the statement that states "Based
              on my experience [interacting with HISP Service], I trust [HISP]
              to deliver on their mission for the American public
            </li>
            <li>
              2. A multiple choice question that asks "What about this
              interaction made the difference?"
            </li>
            <li>
              3. Open-ended question with the statement below that states
              "Anything else you want us to know about your experience?"
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A-11 surveys administered in Touchpoints are limited to</li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>No more than 20 survey questions in total per survey.</li>
            <li>
              "Custom Questions" must be limited to questions that would be
              considered a non-substantive, non-sensitive question related to
              operational information that helps to put the customer feedback into
              a useable context for the agency. This could include asking which
              service center location was visited, or which service or inquiry
              type the interaction was related to. The Feedback Analytics team
              reserves the right to deem whether a question is appropriate under
              the PRA clearance that GSA operates for this tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Agencies should use the statement provided for the required three
              (3) questions and make only minor edits. Any requested modifications
              to the wording of these statements must first be discussed with OMB
              prior to implementation in order to maintain reporting comparability
              government-wide.
            </li>
            <li>
              Agency customers will be required to provide the Feedback Analytics
              team with information needed in order to develop PRA supporting
              statements. The Feedback Analytics team will provide this form,
              review agency completed information, and submit for PRA clearance
              via the GSA A-11 generic government-wide clearance.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Agencies will be provided with the final PRA supporting statements for
          their records, but are not required to submit these documents. GSA
          will assume the burden hours and manage all ICR approvals, updates,
          and renewals for the A-11 form in Touchpoints. The Feedback Analytics
          team will insert the OMB control number into the survey instrument.
        </li>
        <li>
          Agencies will need to notify the Feedback Analytics team if they wish
          to make any changes to the information collection. This would include
          any change to the instrument itself (e.g., question wording), or the
          delivery mechanism (e.g., potential sample) that would result in
          changes to the clearance of the information collection.
        </li>
        <li>
          The GSA RegSec team will review internal GSA PRA within five (5)
          business days.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="users">4.0 SERVICE PURPOSE AND POTENTIAL USERS</h3>
      <p>
        This project provides a means for agencies to manage customer and
        stakeholder feedback in an efficient, timely manner in compliance with
        Section 280 of OMB Circular A-11 at
        https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/s280.pdf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Section 280.7 establishes seven domains for measuring customer
        experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service Quality (1) Service Effectiveness/Perception of Value</li>
        <li>
          Process: (2) Ease/Simplicity, (3) Efficiency/Speed, (4)
          Equity/Transparency
        </li>
        <li>
          People: (5) Employee Interaction/ Warmth/ Helpfulness/ Competence
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        High Impact Service Providers listed at
        https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/ are required to ask questions to
        assess customer experience in regards to their respective services. All
        agencies are encouraged to meausre their customer experience in line
        with these standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to increase adoption of these measures and establish efficiency
        and cost savings in their administration and collection, the Office of
        Products and Programs Feedback Analytics team is supporting High Impact
        Service Providers, and in the future, other interested agencies, in
        administering their customer feedback collections. OIRA supports GSA
        owning a generic clearance for section 280 customer feedback surveys on
        behalf of other agencies. OIRA believes it will both increase the
        quality of customer feedback collections and streamline workload for
        both agencies and OIRA. These collections will be submitted under the
        GSA burden hour calculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following review and disposition of public comments on the 60-day

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The collections are voluntary;</li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          The collections are non-controversial and do not raise issues of
          concern to other Federal agencies;
        </li>
        <li>
          Any collection is targeted to the solicitation of opinions from
          respondents who have experience with the program or may have
          experience with the program in the near future;
        </li>
        <li>

        feedback to contribute directly to the improvement of program
        management. These responses will inform efforts to improve or maintain
        the quality of service offered to the public. If this information is not
        collected, vital feedback from customers and stakeholders on services
        will be unavailable.

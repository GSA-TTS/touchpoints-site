      PRA-friendly A-11 Form
    </strong>
    <p>
      PRA requirements exist to ensure public data is used in a compliant,
      authorized way. We've worked with OIRA to streamline Touchpoints' A-11 form approval under a GSA-managed generic clearance, reducing time-to-approval to <strong>10 days or less.</strong>

      Multi-modal survey delivery
    </strong>
    <p>
      Use a Touchpoints-hosted form by sharing the URL via any of your existing tools.
      Or, deploy a Touchpoint on your own web property with a script tag.
